# **[Autodidact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodidacticism) = Self-Taught**

_Usually Autodidacts & Self-Taught people didn't go to college and don't have a degree from a University... but this is not always the case_


Here are some scenarios:
1. A computer science grad with an B.S. & M.S. teach themselves new tech they didn't learn in school.
2. A grad with a non-technical degree wants to learn to code to get a better job.
3. A college dropout that keeps teaching themselves new skills.
4. Middle School & High School students that learn advanced skills out of curiosity outside of school.

**Unfortunately many jobs still discriminate against autodidacts & self-taught people by requiring a degree üò†** 

**My goal is to help end this discrimination ‚úä**

**There are also many jobs that don't require a degree. Companies like Google & Neuralink accept equivalent practical experience ‚ù§Ô∏è**

This repository will be a cloud app to try to help autodidact & self-taught people. 
I have a few idea's I'll try to do this:
- Prove that it is possible to earn a master‚Äôs degree equivalent via an autodidact education
- Develop curriculum for the most popular graduate programs using purely autodidact methodology. 
  - There will be a filter search controls to render guides & resources that can be used in an easy-to-understand syllabus like UI component
- Build a "hours worked in the last year" visualization VERY similar to the GitHub "contributions in the last year" visualization
  - I might just integrate Tableau for this
  - It will also show an outline of what the autodidact/self-taught person worked on (like what they studied or projects they did)

Personally I passionately disagree with bachelors degree programs. In the 4+ years it takes to earn
a bachelors degree you could earn 2+ masters' degrees.
So I will focus on masters' degree equivalent autodidact education

## Please Anyone who supports autodidact/self-taught education:
contribute 
1. code, 
2. idea's, 
3. advice,
4. your autodidact/self-taught education experience
   1. For now, I only have my own autodidact education to go off of, so I like to learn about other peoples. 

... This is going to be an extremely long-term project. I plan to work on it 1-hour a weekend.
